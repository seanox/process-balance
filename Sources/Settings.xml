    Number of workers who monitor the prioritization of the processes. They
    share the monitoring to be able to react faster.
    In practice, approx. 50 - 75 processes per worker have proven successful.

    Default value: 5

  <!--
    Threshold value from which the automatic prioritization of overactive
    processes begins. Processes that reach the threshold are first Idle, later
    prioritized to BelowNormal when the CPU load normalizes, if the base
    priority is higher.
    
    Value Range: 0 - 100 
    Default value: 25

  <!--
    Minimum of seconds that must be reached where the CPU load is below the
    threshold before the prioritization is changed from Idle to BelowNormal.

    List of process names, also called image names, which temporarily disable
    automatic prioritization. Prioritization is only resumed when none of the
    processes listed here are running. This is useful for games, compilers,
    renderers and all programs that should use the CPU without restrictions.
    The process names are separated by spaces.

  <!--
    List of process names, also called image names, whose priority is always
    set to BelowNormal, even if they did not reach the maximum allowed CPU
    usage before. This is useful when processes like compiler, interpreter and
    indexer work very well even at low priority.  
    The process names are separated by spaces.
